The program takes a name input and does various tasks.

First, it asks for what your middle child's name be if you have 3 children.
Second, it asks how old you currently are and gives a comment on that age.
Lastly, it gives you your age in years of a small dog.

As part of our code of conduct you should respect others, members who do so can and will be reported and removed from the group.

Our lisence is under the creative commons which allows the adaptation and use of the project, even for commerical purposes.
